# reddit April Fools Day 2020 - Imposter

A bunch of random data I collected from Imposter

Not sure why I thought it would be a good idea to push a commit every time a file updated but hey here we are.

`content` contains the file contents pulled from `links.txt`.

`status_alltime.json` - Resulting query from the `/status` endpoint, roughly once a minute.  Timestamped in UTC.

`status_malformed.json` - At the very beginning, `/status` was including random users data, this is what I collected before they fixed it.
